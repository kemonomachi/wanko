Wanko - RSS Torrent Fetcher

Description
-----------

Fetches torrent file links from RSS feeds based on user-specified rules. The
links can be printed to stdout or sent to Transmission for download, or the
torrent files can be downloaded to a watchdir for processing by other torrent
clients.

Usage
-----

    wanko [options]

The optional -c switch specifies the configuration directory, which defaults to
$HOME/.wanko.

See 'wanko --help' for usage info.

Can be run manually, but creating a cron job to run it at regular intervals is
recommended. It is not a daemon.

Configuration
-------------

The config file is named 'config.yaml'. The example folder contains a full
example config. RSS feeds, default fetch directory, fetch method and rules can
be specified. Regexen are used to match torrents against rules.

The config directory also holds 'history.yaml', which contains already read RSS
items. This prevents fetching the same torrent multiple times.

About the Name
--------------

Wanko (わんこ) is Japanese for 'doggy'. Because it's small and it fetches
stuff for you.
